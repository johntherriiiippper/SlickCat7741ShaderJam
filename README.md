FYI those of you who came here, a chromebook is a device produced by many electronics companies(dell, hp, lenovo) that is a small lightweight and not powerful laptop device. it is installed with an operating system called ChromeOS, which has many bugs and issues, and it is for us to help find those issues for google for them to patch them, but in the mean time its not a bad idea to take advantage of those and maybe try somehting new! Lmao most hacks here might already be patched but still its worth a try!
